# FlashyFlasher

## Introduction

This folder hosts the code for an ESP32-based assembler and loader for the Hackaday Supercon/Berlin badge.
It uses any generic ESP32 board running Circuitpython.

## Requirements

- ESP32 board with at least 2 available GPIO (we assigned Tx=3 and Rx=5)
- Hackaday Berlin badge (duh), UART pins (on the expandion header, pins 2 and 3) connected to the ESP32 with the beforementioned pins.

## Notes

Don't connect to the SAO header as it can't be used for loading programs (at the time of writing this documentation).  
Circuitpython must already be installed on your ESP32. [More info here](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-with-esp32-quick-start/installing-circuitpython).  
When connecting the ESP32 to a computer, make sure you're not backfeeding power from the USB interface from the ESP32 back to the badge.
Be patient when running the assembler, it might take up to 10s on a heavy program!  
To add files, connect the ESP32 to your computer (it should show up as a flashdrive). Drag and drop .asm files in the "data" folder.  

## Milestones

- [x] ~~Directly upload a .hex file from the ESP32.~~ Finished just in time for the badge demoscene
- [x] ~~Integrate the assembler in the the FlashyFlasher.~~ Slow but works
- [] Implement a web interface to choose the .asm file to assemble and send to the badge. (WIP)
  - [x] ~~Create a webpage to upload a default file.~~ Works, but is slow due to re-occuring requests (fix is coming)
  - [] Implement a file selector
  - [] Implement an assembly editor
  - [] Implement an "upload file" option
- [] Make it word with in "AP mode" or "Network" mode.
